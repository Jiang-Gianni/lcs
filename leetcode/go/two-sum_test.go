// 1 - Two Sum (Easy)
// https://leetcode.com/problems/two-sum

// Hint 0
// A really brute force way would be to search for all possible pairs of numbers but that would be too slow. Again, it&#39;s best to try out brute force solutions for just for completeness. It is from these brute force solutions that you can come up with optimizations.

// Hint 1
// So, if we fix one of the numbers, say &lt;code&gt;x&lt;/code&gt;, we have to scan the entire array to find the next number &lt;code&gt;y&lt;/code&gt; which is &lt;code&gt;value - x&lt;/code&gt; where value is the input parameter. Can we change our array somehow so that this search becomes faster?

// Hint 2
// The second train of thought is, without changing the array, can we use additional space somehow? Like maybe a hash map to speed up the search?

package solution

// import "testing"

// func Testtest(t *testing.T) {

// }

func twoSum(nums []int, target int) []int {

}
